"""Minimal ASI system stub.

This module provides a lightweight, safe stub implementation of an "ASI system"
for local development and tests. It intentionally avoids external dependencies
and network calls. The class here can be imported by other modules that expect
an ASI-like interface while you build the real implementation.

Public API:
- ASISystem: simple class with start(), stop(), and health_check().
- run_cli(): a tiny CLI entrypoint for manual smoke testing.

The code is purposefully minimal to keep tests fast and deterministic.
