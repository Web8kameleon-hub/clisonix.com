📋 Recommended Configuration:
   - Pool Mode: transaction (one connection per transaction)
   - Pool Size: 25 (default)
   - Min Size: 10
   - Max Size: 50
   - Client Connections: 1000

🎯 Tuning Tips:
   1. For 4 CPU cores: pool_size = (4 * 2) + reserve = 13-25
   2. For 7.6GB RAM: shared_buffers = 2GB (25% of RAM)
   3. work_mem per connection: 256MB / 25 = ~10MB per query
   4. max_connections should be < (pool_size * num_services)

⚠️ To apply PostgreSQL changes:
   docker restart clisonix-postgres

🔍 To verify pooling:
   SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';
   SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'idle in transaction';
