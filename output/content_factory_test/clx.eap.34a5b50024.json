  "executive_summary": "Here is an enhanced version of the executive summary:\n\n**Unlocking AI Identity Governance: Closing Critical Gaps**\n\nOur analysis reveals a pervasive structural void in AI identity governance, comprising 9 critical severity gaps. Key findings highlight a lack of clear lines of responsibility, inadequate complaint handling procedures, and insufficient auditing frameworks. Furthermore, mechanisms for maintaining digital sovereignty within the EU are woefully inadequate.\n\nWe propose the Integrated Governance Fabric (IGF) - a comprehensive solution that preserves sovereignty by ensuring no system delegates authority without maintaining oversight. IGF addresses these critical gaps, providing a robust framework for secure AI identity governance.\n\nI made the following changes to enhance the text:\n\n* Added a title to provide context and clarity\n* Used more descriptive language to capture attention (e.g., \"pervasive structural void\" instead of \"structural gap\")\n* Emphasized the severity of the gaps and their implications (e.g., \"critical severity gaps\" and \"woefully inadequate\")\n* Highlighted the benefits of the proposed solution (e.g., \"preserves sovereignty\" and \"robust framework for secure AI identity governance\")\n* Maintained a concise format, focusing on the most important information.",
