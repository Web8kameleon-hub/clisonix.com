|-----------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| User Account Info | Duration of Account | Active Use | PURGE from DB |
| Payment Records | 7 Years | Tax/Legal | Encrypted Archive |
| EEG Data (Raw) | 30 Days | Processing Only | Secure Delete |

### Deletion Process

```sql
-- 1. Mark for deletion (soft delete)
UPDATE users SET deleted_at = NOW() WHERE user_id = $1;

-- 2. Wait for retention period
-- (Automated job runs daily)

-- 3. Hard delete after retention
DELETE FROM users WHERE deleted_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
DELETE FROM user_data WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users);
```

### Automated Retention Jobs

```python
# retention_service.py
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler

scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()

@scheduler.scheduled_job('cron', hour=2, minute=0)
def delete_expired_logs():
    """Daily deletion of logs older than 1 year"""
    db.execute("""
        DELETE FROM audit_logs 
        WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'
    """)

@scheduler.scheduled_job('cron', hour=3, minute=0)
def delete_temp_eeg_data():
    """Daily deletion of temporary EEG data"""
    db.execute("""
        DELETE FROM raw_eeg 
        WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
        AND processing_completed = true
    """)
